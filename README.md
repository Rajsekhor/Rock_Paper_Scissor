# Rock_Paper_Scissor

This is a project provided by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

In this model, we modified the code of abbey. We also took references from our fellow peers in a discussion forum without whose support we might not had been able to complete our project. Our model was able to achieve a winrate of above 60% on the 4 bots provided to us.

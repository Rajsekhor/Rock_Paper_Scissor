# Rock_Paper_Scissor

This is a project provided by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

In this model, we modified the code of abbey. We also took references from our fellow peers in a discussion forum without whose support we might not had been able to complete our project. Our model was able to achieve a winrate of above 60% on the 4 bots provided to us.

For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.
